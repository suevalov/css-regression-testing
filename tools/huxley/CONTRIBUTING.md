# Contributing to Huxley

Huxley is currently used to test Instagram.com. As such, any pull requests that come in will be checked against that. Hopefully we'll have an automated acceptance testing solution in place soon (PRs accepted!).

### Contributor License Agreement ("CLA")

In order to accept your pull request, we need you to submit a CLA. You only need to do this once, so if you've done this for another Facebook open source project, you're good to go. If you are submitting a pull request for the first time, just let us know that you have completed the CLA and we can cross-check with your GitHub username.
